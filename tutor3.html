        Hi everyone! In the <a href="./tutor2" class="button">previous part</a>, we added Firebase to our project through the Swift Package Manager, but you may have noticed an error when trying to run the app:

      <p class="txt">
        <em>GoogleService-Info.plist</em> is essentially a config file so FirebaseSwift knows where to add users, read databases etc. To get this file, we'll need to make a Firebase project in the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com" class="button">Firebase console</a>. Head to this website and get ready for the next few steps!
      </p>

      <p class="txt">
        Go ahead and add a new project. In the screen that appears, give your project a name (I named mine <em>Tutorial-backend</em>). Next, you should see a scren asking if you want to enable <em>Google Analytics</em>. As we won't need it for our app, you can disable it. Then, hit <b>Create Project</b>!
      </p>

      <p class="txt">
        A Firebase project can have <em>multiple apps</em>. In Firebase's language, an app is a connection to a different project, such as an iOS Swift project! Press the 'iOS' icon on the dashboard (as you can see in the image) and you should see a screen like this:
      </p>

      <p class="txt">
        Go to your Xcode project and copy the Bundle ID like in the below image. You can then go ahead an paste it into Firebase! Once you've entered your Bundle ID in, you can <em>register your app</em> ready for the next few instructions.
      </p>

      <p class="txt">
        You should now see a big ol' button to <em>download GoogleService-Info.plist</em>, the file we needed! Download it and move back to Xcode (you can skip steps 3-5 as we don't need them - but remember to add the app!). There, drag the file from Finder to the root of your Xcode project. If asked, make sure to add to <em>all</em> targets, and you should be good to go! Try running the app, and it should work just fine!
      </p>

        Congrats - you've successfully setup your Xcode application properly with Firebase! In the next part coming soon, we'll start working on the <em>Authentication</em> system and allow users to login and sign up to the app. Until then, happy coding :)
