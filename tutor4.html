          Hello awesome developers, in the <a href="./tutor3" class="button">last part</a>, we set up our Firebase
          project and connected it to our Xcode project. Today, we'll be setting up Authentication with our project :)
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var email = ""
    @State var password = ""

    @StateObject var firebaseManager = FirebaseManager()

    init() {
      FirebaseApp.configure()
    }
          
    var body: some View {
       NavigationStack {
          VStack {
            TextField("Email", text: $email)
              .keyboardType(.emailAddress)
  
            SecureField("Password", text: $password)

            Button("Sign In") {
              firebaseManager.signIn(email, password)
            }
            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
          }
          .padding()
          .navigationTitle("Login")
       }
    }
}          
        </code>
      </pre>

        <p class="txt">
          Go ahead and write this code in <em>ContentView.swift</em>. If you wish, you can design your own UI, but make
          sure you have an email and a password variable. When you've got your view just the way you want it, switch
          back to your Firebase console for the next few steps :)
        </p>

          In order for Authentication to work with our app, we'll need to enable it in our Firebase project. In your console you should see a screen similar to the one above. Select <em>Authentication</em> and then press <em>Get Started</em>. There should be a tab named <em>Sign in Methods</em> - switch to it at you should be at a screen similar to the screenshot below:
        </p>

          For now, we'll only be adding the typical email and password sign in method, but you can add more sign in methods later (stay tuned for a Sign in with Google tutorial üòÅ)! Select <em>Email/Password</em> and turn on the <em>email and password</em> switch. Later, you can also add the option for a passwordless sign in :) Once we're done, you can go ahead and add your <em>first</em> user in the <em>Users</em> tab! Once you're ready, switch back to <em>FirebaseManager.swift</em> in your Xcode project and get ready for some exciting coding üòÉ
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
func signIn(_ email: String, _ password: String) {
    let auth = Auth.auth()
}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p class="txt">
        We'll first initialise an instance of <em>Auth.auth()</em>. This is basically the object that has all the goodies we want :) Now comes the fun part...
      </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
func signIn(_ email: String, _ password: String) {
    let auth = Auth.auth()

    auth.signIn(withEmail: email, password: password) { result, error in
        if let error = error {
          print("An error occured while signing in: \(error.localizedDescription)")
          return
        }

        guard let uid = auth.currentUser?.uid else { return }

        // Now we're signed in, you can do whatever you want!
    }
}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p class="txt">
        Yep - it's as simple as that! You have access to the current user's data throughout the entire session using the optional <em>auth.currentUser?</em> ! This will return nil if no user is signed in. Some great news is that registering a user is <em>just</em> as easy as signing in:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
func registerUser(_ email: String, _ password: String) {
    let auth = Auth.auth()

    auth.createUser(withEmail: email, password: password) { result, error in
        if let error = error {
          print("An error occured while signing up: \(error.localizedDescription)")
          return
        }

        guard let uid = auth.currentUser?.uid else { return }

        // The user is now registered and signed in - do whatever setup here :)
    }
}
        </code>
      </pre>

        Awesome - right? Firebase is a great tool and is surprisingly easy to use with Swift! In the next part, we'll look at integrating Firebase Firestore into our app too - you could potentially get started early by enabling Firestore in the console, or you could wait until the next tutorial! Until then, happy coding :)
